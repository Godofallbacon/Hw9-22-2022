methods use isntance variable values
When you write a class you are describing how the JVM should make the object of that type
Methods use parameters while a caller passes arguements
If a method takes a parameter you MUST pas is something
Methods can have multiple parameters but they must be seperated with commas
If you want to know if two primitives are the same use == operator
The == operator cares only about the pattern of bits in the variable
Developing a class:
figure out what the class is supposed to do
list the instance variables and methods
write some pseudocode to help focus on you process
write a class or method that we can use to test 
implement the class and then test the methods
Write your psuedo code before you start writing your variables and methods
When you put an object in a Arraylist you can treat it only as an object
when you get a reference from an Arraylist the reference is always of type object
you can only call a method on an object only if the class of the reference variable has that method
the compiler checks the class of the reference variable not the class of the actual object
use the keyword interface instead of class to define an interface
interface methods are public and abstract
polymorphism interfaces use interfaces instead of concrete subclasses as arguements and return types
the gc can destroy the object and reclaim the memory that object was using
if the local variable is a referance to an object only the variable goes on the stack 
the three steps of object declaration and assignment:
declare a refernce variable
create an object
assign the object to the reference
A constructor has the code that runs when you instantiate an object
